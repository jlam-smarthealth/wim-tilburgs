🚀 I just spent €25 testing Grok AI, and the results shocked me.

While everyone's obsessing over ChatGPT, Elon Musk quietly gave 500 million X users an AI assistant that:

✅ Has real-time data (ChatGPT is stuck in April 2024)
✅ Costs €8/month (vs €20 for ChatGPT Plus)  
✅ Lives where people already are (inside X)
✅ Actually has personality and humor

After 50+ test queries, my verdict: For 80% of use cases, Grok is BETTER than ChatGPT.

1/ 🧵 I just spent €25 testing @xai's Grok API

The tech world is looking the wrong way

While everyone counts ChatGPT downloads, @elonmusk quietly deployed the biggest AI distribution in history

500M people now have AI built into their social media

Here's what I found →

2/ First, the basics:
- €8/month with X Premium (vs €20 ChatGPT)
- Real-time data access (this is HUGE)
- 100 messages/day
- Actually funny and honest
- No corporate censorship

But that's not the real story...

3/ The REAL innovation:

Grok doesn't make you go to IT
IT comes to YOU

You're scrolling X, see something interesting, ask Grok about it INSTANTLY

No app switching. No copy-paste. It's just THERE.

4/ My test results after €25 in API credits:

✅ Current events: Grok DESTROYS ChatGPT
✅ Trending topics: Not even close
✅ Personality: Grok is hilarious
❌ Coding: ChatGPT still wins
✅ Price/value: Grok by a mile

5/ The controversy nobody talks about:

Grok knows what you tweet
Sees who you follow
Understands your interests

Privacy nightmare? Yes
Incredibly useful? Also yes

We gave our data to X anyway. At least now we get an AI back.

6/ My prediction:

In 12 months, X won't be a social network with an AI

It'll be an AI with a social network attached

Bank + Payments + Social + AI = Everything App

Elon's not building Twitter 2.0
He's building the Matrix

7/ Bottom line:

Stop waiting. Get X Premium today.

Not for the blue check
Not for less ads
For the AI that knows what's happening NOW

Switch your AI, change your life 🤖⚡

I went from ChatGPT ($20/month, outdated) to Grok AI ($8/month, real-time) and I'm never going back.

Swipe for the comparison that'll blow your mind →

The future isn't about having AI.
It's about AI that KNOWS what's happening NOW.

🤖 I just discovered something that's going to change how we all use AI...

Remember when you had to choose between:
- Expensive AI ($20/month for ChatGPT)
- Or outdated free options?

Well, Elon Musk just changed the game.

For €8/month with X Premium, you get Grok AI which:
→ Knows what's happening RIGHT NOW (not months ago)
→ Is built into X (Twitter) - no extra app needed
→ Actually has personality and makes jokes
→ Gives honest answers without corporate filters

I spent €25 testing it thoroughly, comparing with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

The verdict? For most everyday uses, Grok is BETTER and CHEAPER.
