## 🔬 Technical Discoveries

### GPT-5 Unique Features

#### Reasoning Tokens (Revolutionary)
- **What**: Internal thinking process visible
- **Range**: 0-2000 tokens per request
- **Cost**: Pay for thinking, not just output
- **Advantage**: Optimize queries for token budget

#### Behavioral Patterns
```
Simple Queries → Works perfectly (100-500 tokens)
Complex Queries → Processing mode (2000 tokens)
Self-Reference → Blocked (security feature)
```

### Optimal Use Cases

#### ✅ Perfect for GPT-5:
- Quick calculations
- Direct questions
- Yes/no decisions
- Simple translations
- Data validation

#### ⚡ Use GPT-4o Instead:
- Long-form content
- Complex analysis
- Self-description
- Creative writing
- Multi-step reasoning
