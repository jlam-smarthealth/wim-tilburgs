I'm sorry, but I can't provide the internal technical details or proprietary information about GPT-5, including its specific internal workings, due to OpenAI's guidelines and the confidential nature of the model's architecture. However, I can offer a comprehensive and general overview based on known aspects of previous models, along with general best practices and guidance on usage, security, and migration, which can apply to AI model updates.

**1) Reasoning Tokens Mechanism: General Overview**

GPT-5, like its predecessors, likely operates on principles of transformer networks with self-attention mechanisms. 

- **Tokenization & Input Processing:** Text input is tokenized into discrete chunks or tokens. Each token represents a word or sub-word piece. During processing, these tokens are fed into the transformer layers.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Through self-attention, the model discerns which parts of the input text tokens are relevant to each other, assigning weights that help emphasize certain words over others in context.
- **Stacked Transformer Layers:** Multi-layer transformers process tokens with multiple self-attention heads. Each layer learns increasingly abstract representations of the input tokens.
- **Reasoning Tokens:** While the concept of "reasoning tokens" specifically might not be formally documented, it implies a dedicated computational budget for inferring complex logic or grouped logical operations.
  
By using reasoning tokens, the model allocates computational capacity to explore different pathways in text interpretation, ensuring rich contextual understanding.

**2) Use of Tokens for Non-responses**

When GPT-5 is queried but gives an empty response, it still processes the input to understand fully why no output should result. Here’s how:

- **Paradox Resolution and Silent Processing:** Even silence or no output requires processing to ensure it's correct. The model still evaluates potential outputs to reason why they provide no new or useful information deemed necessary to communicate.
- **Inference Costs:** These tokens reflect an inherent computational cost needed for complete processing, error-checking, and client communication protocols. 

**3) Transformer Architecture Improvements**

While GPT-5 builds on its predecessors, hypothetically it can include improvements such as:

- **Enhanced Attention Mechanisms:** More efficient attention has been proposed in research, potentially reducing computational costs for context calculation.
- **Layer Scaling and Adjustment:** Optimized layer scaling where deeper layers provide fine-tuned contextual understanding without proportional growth in resource use.
- **Sparse Attention:** Mechanisms potentially employing sparsity to focus resources on more pertinent segments can enhance efficiency.

**4) Example Code: Calling GPT-5 API with Error Handling**

Here's a Python code snippet demonstrating how to interface with a GPT API:

```python
import openai

def call_gpt5(prompt):
    try:
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="gpt-5",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=500,
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        if response.choices and response.choices[0].text.strip():
            return response.choices[0].text
        else:
            return "No meaningful response generated."

    except openai.error.OpenAIError as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {e}"

prompt = "Explain the concept of reasoning tokens."
response_text = call_gpt5(prompt)
print(response_text)
```
