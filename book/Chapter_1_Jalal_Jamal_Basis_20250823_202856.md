# Hoofdstuk 1: De Basis van Jalal & Jamal

*"In het hart van elke transformatie schuilen twee krachten..."*


## What is Jalal in Sufism?

In Sufi thought, Jalal means the Divine Majesty—God’s awesome, awe‑inspiring aspect that manifests as rigor, power, justice, and overwhelming grandeur. It is often paired with Jamal (Beauty, mercy, tenderness) and completed by Kamal (Perfection that harmonizes both).

Key points:
- Root and scripture: From the Arabic j‑l‑l (greatness, grandeur). Echoed in the Qur’anic phrase “Dhu’l‑Jalali wal‑Ikram” (Lord of Majesty and Generosity).
- Attributes: Jalali Names (often listed by Sufis) include al‑‘Aziz (The Mighty), al‑Qahhar (The Subduer), al‑Jabbar (The Compeller), al‑Qadir (All‑Powerful), al‑Hakam (The Judge), al‑‘Adl (The Just), al‑Muntaqim (The Avenger). They evoke awe, sobriety, and moral seriousness.
- Inner states: Jalal tends to appear as qabd (constriction), haybah (awe), and khawf (reverent fear). Jamal appears as bast (expansion), uns (intimacy), and mahabbah (love). The path alternates between these so the ego is humbled (Jalal) and the heart is soothed (Jamal).
- Practice and adab: Jalal calls for repentance, humility, discipline, patience, and ethical rectitude. One holds a balance between fear and hope, not mistaking Jalal for mere “anger,” nor Jamal for permissiveness.
- Aim: The mature seeker perceives both faces—Majesty and Beauty—as one Reality; Kamal is their integration, yielding wholeness and wisdom.

So, Jalal is the face of God’s Majesty that purifies, sets limits, and awakens awe—complementing, not contradicting, Divine Beauty.

## What is Jamal in Sufism?

In Sufism, Jamal means the Divine Beauty—God’s gentle, attractive, mercy-filled aspect. It’s one of a paired polarity:

- Jamal (Beauty): tenderness, grace, mercy, love, forgiveness, intimacy.
- Jalal (Majesty): awe, power, rigor, transcendence, might.

Key points:
- Related Divine Names: al-Jamil (the Beautiful), al-Rahman/ al-Rahim (the All-Merciful/Compassionate), al-Latif (the Subtle), al-Wadud (the Loving), al-Ghaffar (the Forgiving).
- Inner experience: Jamal discloses itself (tajalli) as uns (intimacy), basṭ (expansion), sakina (tranquil presence), joy and attraction. Jalal tends to bring haybah (awe), qabḍ (contraction), fear and reverence.
- Ethics and character: Jamal cultivates rifq (gentleness), hilm (forbearance), ihsan (excellence/beautifying one’s conduct), compassion toward creation.
- Practice: Dhikr and adab attuned to Jamal emphasize gratitude, love, and contemplation of beauty in creation; the proper response is shukr (thankfulness) and mahabbah (love).
- Balance: The mature Sufi seeks the harmony of Jamal and Jalal, which yields Kamal (perfection/completeness). Too much of one without the other distorts the path.
- In poetry and aesthetics: Sufi art and verse often celebrate Jamal—beauty as a veil and a mirror of the Real, drawing the lover toward the Beloved. The hadith “God is Beautiful and loves beauty” is foundational here.

In short, Jamal is how the Divine captivates and softens the heart through beauty and mercy, complementing the awe of Jalal, and together guiding the seeker toward perfected balance.

## Define Kamal in Islamic mysticism

Kamal (Arabic: kamāl) in Islamic mysticism (Sufism) means spiritual perfection or full maturity. It is the realized wholeness of the human being when all innate potentials are harmonized and brought into conformity with the Divine Names and qualities.

Key points:
- Ultimate reference: Absolute perfection (al-kamāl al-muṭlaq) belongs to God alone; human kamal is participatory and relative—reflecting, not possessing, divine perfection.
- Human ideal: Al-insān al-kāmil (“the Perfect Human”) is the Sufi ideal of a person who becomes a complete mirror of God’s Names, integrating body, soul, and spirit, and uniting outward law (sharī‘a) with inward truth (ḥaqīqa).
- Path and fruition: Kamal is the ripened fruit of the path (ṭarīqa)—through remembrance (dhikr), struggle against the ego (mujāhada), right conduct (adab), companionship with a realized guide, and the stations of fanā’ (ego-effacement) and baqā’ (subsistence in God).
- Ethico-spiritual sense: It appears as kamālāt (perfections/virtues)—excellence of character (makārim al-akhlāq), ihsān (spiritual excellence), wisdom, compassion, and balance.
- Linguistic nuance: Tamām is “completion” (having all parts); kamāl is “perfection” (those parts ordered at their highest). Sufis often reserve kamal for the consummated, luminous maturity of the soul.
- Usage: A realized guide may be called shaykh al-kāmil (perfect master). The name “Kamal” as a personal name derives from this notion of perfection.

Scriptural grounding: While “kamāl” per se is a technical Sufi term, its root appears in the Qur’an (e.g., “Today I have perfected [akmaltu] for you your religion,” Q 5:3), and the Prophetic mission is described as perfecting noble character—both taken by Sufis as the template for kamal.

## Who was Ibn Arabi?

Ibn ‘Arabī (1165–1240), often called al-Shaykh al-Akbar “the Greatest Master,” was an Andalusian-born Sufi mystic, philosopher, and poet whose ideas profoundly shaped Islamic spirituality, philosophy, and literature from the Maghreb to South Asia.

- Life: Born in Murcia, raised in Seville; famous youthful encounter with the philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes) in Córdoba; extensive travels through North Africa and the Middle East; long retreat in Mecca; final years in Damascus, where he is buried.
- Major works:
  - Al-Futūhāt al-Makkiyya (The Meccan Openings): encyclopedic synthesis of Sufi practice, cosmology, and metaphysics.
  - Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam (The Bezels of Wisdom): brief but dense metaphysical meditations framed around the wisdom of prophets.
  - Tarjumān al-Ashwāq (Interpreter of Desires): love poetry with mystical commentary.
- Key ideas:
  - Unity of Being (wahdat al-wujūd): later label for his vision that all existence is the self-disclosure (tajallī) of the One Reality; he stresses experiential realization over abstract doctrine.
  - The Perfect Human (al-insān al-kāmil): the complete mirror of divine names, epitomized by the Prophet Muhammad.
  - The imaginal world (ʿālam al-mithāl): an intermediate “barzakh” realm of forms where spiritual realities appear—crucial for dreams, visions, and eschatology.
  - Muhammadan Reality (al-ḥaqīqa al-muḥammadiyya), sainthood and the “Seal of Saints,” the primacy of direct knowledge (maʿrifa).
- Legacy: Enormous influence on Sufi orders and on Ottoman, Persian, and Indo-Muslim thought and poetry; defended by major Sufis (e.g., Ṣadr al-Dīn al-Qūnawī, ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Jīlī, Jāmī) and criticized by some jurists-theologians (notably Ibn Taymiyya). His ideas continue to be studied worldwide; key modern scholars include Henry Corbin, William Chittick, Michel Chodkiewicz, Claude Addas, and James Morris.

In short, Ibn ‘Arabī is the preeminent theoretician of Sufism, whose visionary metaphysics and poetic language aim to articulate how the One discloses itself in the many and how the heart comes to know that Reality.

## What is dhikr practice?

Dhikr (also spelled zikr) literally means “remembrance.” In Islam it refers to consciously remembering and mentioning God (Allah) with the tongue and the heart, cultivating constant awareness of Him.

Common forms
- Simple phrases: 
  - Subhanallah (Glory be to God)
  - Alhamdulillah (All praise is due to God)
  - Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest)
  - La ilaha illa Allah (There is no god but God)
  - Astaghfirullah (I seek God’s forgiveness)
- After the five daily prayers: often 33× Subhanallah, 33× Alhamdulillah, 34× Allahu Akbar.
- Reciting Qur’an, sending blessings on the Prophet (salawat), and calling on the Beautiful Names of God (Asma’ al-Husna).
- Silent, internal remembrance throughout the day.
- Sufi practice: structured litanies (wird) and group dhikr, sometimes rhythmic, with breath and posture (hadra in some orders).

How to practice
- Set intention (ikhlas) and presence of heart.
- Choose a phrase or Name, understand its meaning, and repeat slowly with attentive breath.
- Use prayer beads (misbaha/tasbih) if helpful, or a timer/count in your heart.
- Pick a consistent time (e.g., after prayers, morning/evening) and a calm place.
- Let the remembrance carry into daily acts—mindful, ethical living is also dhikr.

Etiquette and aims
- Sincerity, humility, and consistency matter more than volume or speed.
- Reflect on meanings; avoid mechanical repetition.
- Goal: a heart at peace, nearness to God, moral refinement. The Qur’an encourages “abundant remembrance” and says hearts find rest in it (e.g., 33:41, 13:28).

In short, dhikr is the practice of keeping God present on the tongue and in the heart—formally through repeated phrases and informally through mindful awareness—until it colors one’s whole life.

## Define Sufi transformation

Sufi transformation is the inner metamorphosis sought in Sufism—from an ego‑driven self to a God‑centered, compassionate, and aware being. It unfolds by purifying the nafs (lower self) and “polishing the heart” through remembrance and disciplined practice, moving from self‑will to divine alignment.

Core features:
- Intention, repentance, and continual self‑accounting (tawba, muhasaba)
- Purification of the self (tazkiya) and cultivation of beautiful character (ihsan)
- Remembrance of God (dhikr), prayer, contemplation (muraqaba), sometimes retreat (khalwa)
- Guidance of a shaykh within a tariqa (path)
- Progress through stations and states (maqamat, ahwal), often described as fana (ego‑annihilation) and baqa (abiding in God)
- Integration of outer practice (shari‘a) with inner realization (haqiqa) leading to gnosis (ma‘rifa)

The outcome is serenity, ethical excellence, and a lived awareness of divine unity (tawhid) expressed in service and love.

## What is spiritual balance?

Spiritual balance is a steady, grounded way of being where your inner life—values, beliefs, sense of meaning—aligns with how you live, so you feel centered, connected, and resilient amid change.

Key elements
- Meaning and purpose: a felt “why” that guides choices.
- Connection: to self (inner honesty), others (care), and something larger (nature, community, the sacred, or a bigger mission).
- Presence: the capacity to be here now with openness and curiosity.
- Values-aligned action: behaving in ways that match what you say matters.
- Compassion with boundaries: kindness without self-erasure.
- Flexibility: humility and wonder alongside reason; able to adapt without losing your core.

How it tends to feel
- Calm but energized, less reactive, clearer priorities, more gratitude and coherence.
- Not the absence of problems, but more inner space to meet them.

Common signs of imbalance
- Chronic emptiness or cynicism, or rigid certainty that shuts learning.
- Value–action gaps (saying one thing, living another).
- Spiritual bypassing (using “spiritual” ideas to avoid real feelings or issues).
- Isolation, chronic busyness, or compulsive striving for worth.

Ways to cultivate it
- Daily micro-practices: 1–3 minute pauses, slow breathing, brief prayer/meditation, gratitude.
- Reflection: journaling on “What matters most? Did today reflect it? One small step tomorrow?”
- Embodied care: sleep, nourishing food, movement, time in nature.
- Service and kindness: small, consistent acts anchor meaning.
- Community and ritual: gather, sing, share, or observe simple rituals.
- Digital hygiene: create quiet spaces for attention and awe.
- Creative expression: music, art, or craft as a doorway to presence.

Remember: balance isn’t a perfect 50/50 or a permanent state; it’s an ongoing alignment you keep tending, like posture—noticed, adjusted, and strengthened over time.
